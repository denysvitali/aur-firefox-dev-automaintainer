# aur-firefox-dev-automaintainer

This package keeps the AUR package [`firefox-dev`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-dev) updated to the latest Firefox Developer edition.  
It does so by checking the official Firefox update service, and it updates the AUR package repo accordingly when there is a new version.  
The script is run every hour on a VPS.

## Usage

Create a folder that acts as a repo (in my case its `~/ffdev-aur/`) and set `@@originalPKGBUILD` accordingly.  
Run the script with `crystal run src/automaintainer.cr`.  
For better performances, build it with `crystal build src/automaintainer.cr --release` and then run it via `./automaintainer`.
